A robust reader for AVI video files.
Originally designed for the [MEVA](http://mevadata.org) dataset to replace [OpenCV](https://opencv.org)'s `cv2.VideoCapture` in the [DIVA](https://www.iarpa.gov/index.php/research-programs/diva) project.

## Installation

```sh
pip install avi-r
```

## Usage

A robust video loader that deals with missing frames in [AVI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Video_Interleave) files.
In `AVI-R`, missing frames are automatically filled with the previous available frame, or the next available frame for the beginning of a video.
This ensures you are getting the correct frame ids and valid frame contents all the time.

In comparison, [OpenCV](https://opencv.org)'s `cv2.VideoCapture` would skip missing frames without warning, leading to wrong frame ids.
And [pims](https://github.com/soft-matter/pims) would return empty frames also without warning.

### Iterator Interface

```python
from avi_r import AVIReader
video = AVIReader(video_path) # or AVIReader(video_name, parent_dir)
for frame in video:
    # frame is a avi_r.frame.Frame object
    image = frame.numpy()
    # image is an uint8 array in a shape of (height, width, channel[BGR])
    # ... Do something with the image
```

### Replace `cv2.VideoCapture`

To replace the `cv2.VideoCapture` objects in legacy codes, simply change from

```python
import cv2
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
```

to

```python
from avi_r import AVIReader
cap = AVIReader(video_path)
```

`AVIReader.read` follows the schema of `cv2.VideoCapture.read` but automatically inserts the missing frames while reading the video.

### Random Access

Random access of a frame requires decoding from the nearest key frame (approximately every 60 frames for MEVA).
Averagely, this introduces a constant overhead of 0.1 seconds.
However, when the nearest key frame is missing, `AVIReader` will try to search a valid one till the beginning.

```python
start_frame_id = 1500
length = 100
video.seek(start_frame_id)
for frame in video.get_iter(length):
    image = frame.numpy()
    # ... Do something with the image
```

### Video Properties

```python
video.width # cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH)
video.height # cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT)
video.fps # cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)
video.length # cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_COUNT)
```
